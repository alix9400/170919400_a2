   <h3>About Proffessor Lovelace</h3>
   <p>Ada Lovelace is an English mathematician and writer who excelled in
    the field of mathematics at a very young age. She is well known for her
  work on  the Analytical Engine. She was one of the first minds gifted enough
to understand the full potential of a machine as much more than just an object used to carry
out calculations. She has worked with many great minds such as Charles Babbage and her love
for both mathematics and teaching is seen in every lecture.</p>
